## üìú Problem Statement

Users face decision fatigue due to an overwhelming amount of content across multiple streaming platforms. Existing recommendation systems operate in silos, failing to leverage cross-platform data for personalized recommendations. 

The Unified Streaming Content Recommendation System aims to solve this by:

1. Aggregating data from various streaming services for cross-platform content discovery.
2. Implementing advanced machine learning to analyze multi-dimensional user data (preferences, histories, contexts) for personalized recommendations.
3. Providing a user-friendly interface to streamline content discovery and reduce decision fatigue.
4. Continuously adapting recommendations through learning capabilities.
5. Offering valuable insights to streaming providers for targeted marketing and subscriber acquisition.

It will revolutionize the streaming experience with personalized, contextually relevant recommendations, enhancing user engagement while driving growth for providers.

## üéØ Project Goals

Our mission is to:

- Enhance the user experience through genre, mood, and occasion-based recommendations.
- Increase user engagement and reduce decision-making time.
- Provide cross-platform insights for content strategies.

## üìä Data Sources

Our enriched dataset is compiled from diverse sources, ensuring a rich selection for recommendation:

- **Kaggle**: Curated datasets from a broad range of streaming content.
- **TMDb API**: Real-time data access to movies and TV shows metadata.

## üõ† Pre-requisites

To get started with our system, you will need:

- Basic understanding of Python and data processing.
- Access to services such as GCP, Snowflake, and PostgreSQL.
- Familiarity with Docker for container management.

## üñ• How to Run Application Locally

To embark on your BingeWatch journey:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Dockerfile to generate the image and run the Docker compose file to bring up the instances.
```
docker build -t <image_name> .
```
```
docker compose up -d
```
This is create an airflow instance, postgresDB, streamlit for frontend and fastapi for backend.
